Project P is a discord bot that I am making that hosts a game allowing users to catch and play a pokemon game

Files: now that I have a dozen goofy named files, I need to define their purpose
    ProjectP.py: this file is the Python file that runs the game, it contains the discord commands and game scripts
    bulba-scraper.py: this file is my first attempt at webscraping the data for my databse, crude and inefficient but it works
    ivy-scraper.py: this file is my second attempt at webscraping, this one was much more efficient
        text.csv: this file holds Catch Rate and XP Type of all the pokemon scraped so they can be added to the data in Pokedex.py and learnsets.py and uploaded to the database
        RotomMow.py: this file is for adding the test.csv data to the database
    Rotom.py: this file is for taking the data from Pokemon Showdown data files and reorganizing it
        Pokedex.py: this file is from the Pokemon Showdown GitHub, modified into a Python dictionary, contains pokemon data
        learnsets.py: this file is from the Pokemon Showdown GitHub, modified into a Python dictionary, contains pokemon learnset data
    bulbasaur.py: this file is for testing fuctions and scripts outside of their larger files
    missingno.py: another file for testing functions, this one was made after the database change and is used primarily for bot functions
