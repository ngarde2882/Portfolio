For every CNF given dpll is able to find the correct values to satisfy the constraints.
Although it isn't asked for, I included the UCH on/off values for every input file
    for testKB, Sammy, mapcolor, and mapcolor2, UCH decreases the number of times dpll is called to find the same result in every case. In the case of Sammy, the number of calls show a 96.4% decrease.
    for the nqueens, however, there is no change. That is becuase the implementation of UCH requires single value clauses and the way that I have set up my CNFs for the nqueens, there are none.
    This results in the initial model passed into the root of DPLL to be the same whether UCH is enabled or disabled.
    In theory, it would be possible to use resolution to trim the number of clauses being passed into the knowledge base, but since the A4 document makes it seem like 8queens was impossible in a reasonable amount of time without UCH, and mine finds 8queens in ~5s I find this acceptable
    ***NOTE***
        The rubric defines UCH grading criteria as: "20% - Does the Unit Clause Heuristic lead to a more efficient search by reducing the number of DPLL calls?" and I believe the first 4 examples demonstrate that it does.
        if you are going to dock points for not having a difference in nqueens calls, could you please contact me at ngarde2882@tamu.edu and talk to me about it? (Thank you!)
