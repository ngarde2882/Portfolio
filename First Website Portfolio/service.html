        <p>&emsp; Over the summer, I got to work at many charity banquets and dinners, raising money for the community of Murfreesboro, and feeding the children while I was working at the <a href="https://alleyonmain.com/" target="_blank">Alley on Main</a>, a restaurant in Murfreesboro Tennessee.</p>
        <p>&emsp; I was given the opportunity, not only to cater and serve these events, but also to help prepare food for them during my time working at the Alley.</p>
        <p>&emsp; I am so happy for the opportunities I had while working at the Alley.</p>

        <p>&emsp; My previous summers were spent teaching kids in Houston how to play tennis. I love playing tennis, and to be able to spark that same passion in my neighborhood was incredibly fun and rewarding.</p>
        <p>&emsp; Every week we got to see both returning and new campers ready to learn and improve their game, nd at the end of every week we would break off into a team competition to show what we had learned.</p>
        <p>&emsp; My time with the West U tennis camp was some of the most fun I've had. I loved working with the other counselors and the kids at the camp, and getting to play tennis every day.</p>
