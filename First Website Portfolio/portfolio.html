        <p> &emsp; In Freshman Year I made a small text-based game that I call Python Dungeon. The game was my first large coding project that I worked on, and I had so much fun creating it. It consisted of the player going through an endless dungeon fighting random monsters to gain XP and level up the skills of their choice to better equip them for future fights. In the future I plan on turning this python text based game into a game with visuals that can be clicked on in Javascript.</p>

            &emsp; I want to work on a simple clicker game that can be played on this page modeled after <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" target="_blank">Cookie Clicker</a> or <a href="https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/" target="_blank">Universal Paperclips</a>. I chose to model a game after these two because they have such a simple premise and literally anywhere to go from their base idea. If you take the time to play through one of these games (which I recommend that you do) or at least read about them, you will see what I mean. Such a simple premise like baking cookies or making paperclips turns into a battle for world domination all too quickly! I would love to create a game like these to help dip my toe in the waters of making games on Javascript, but also to test my storytelling ability along with it trying to make a game that people want to play.

            &emsp; My last current idea for a game to make would be modeled after a game called <a href="https://www.enterthegungeon.com/" target="_blank">Enter the Gungeon</a>. Enter the Gungeon is a top-down bullet hell where the heroes of the story are attempting to fight through the Gungeon in order to find the gun that can kill their past. Top-Down Roguelike Bullet Hell is my long term passion project that I update as I gain more skills in C++ and C#. It is much more ambitious than my other two projects, both in scope and in vision.
