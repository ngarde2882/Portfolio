      <p style="top: 0px;">&emsp; Many of my early courses have increased my interest in Computer Science. I am an avid learner, so I enjoy trying to go above and beyond on my assignments, or even using my classroom experience to enhance my personal projects. Research is a large part of Computer Science because it is an area that is constantly undergoing change and development. Not only do I spend time ensuring that I understand the coding language I am using and the codeâ€™s function, but also learning how to implement that same concept in other ways that will be useful in the future.</p>
      <p style="top: 25px;">&emsp; During my time at A&M, I have been able to both be a full time student and a part-time employee for a <a href="https://www.bestdestinycarries.com/" target="_blank">Destiny carry website</a>. In this employment, it is more important to be professional with my coworkers, clients, and managers, as well as to stay focused on the tasks given. Managing my computer science courses and completing client orders can sometimes feel overwhelming, but I am committed to completing all of my tasks on time. It also taught me that it is often better to collaborate with my coworkers to get things done more efficiently.</p>
      <p style="top: 50px;">&emsp; For two years I worked as a summer counselor at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1678994172410112" target="_blank">Neil Harrison Serves Tennis</a>, a tennis camp where I taught children how to play the game, from the basics to playing competitively against their peers. Through my experiences with this camp, I learned how to collaborate with my fellow counselors, effectively distributing our skills among the different age groups to foster an appropriate learning environment. My first summer I had the pleasure of serving as the camp medic, and was promoted to head counselor when I returned for the second time. Holding those positions allowed me to understand what it means to be responsible, not only for the children we were caring for every week, but also being accountable for the team of counselors I was charged with leading. Those two summers required adaptability, resiliency, and an aptitude for conflict management.</p>
