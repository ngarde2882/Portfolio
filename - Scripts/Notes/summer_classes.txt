career center was more of an echo chamber for my opinions because these were chosen with my interpritations of these classes. whether that's better or worse is up to interpritation

kaiser (cs grad advisor) summer suggestions
313 more important (than 314) for grad school
411 get an A
221 mb mbnot
314 got brought up (honorable mention)
I don't like kaiser's suggestion for 313 over 314 because 313, while 313 is more challenging, is computer engineering related rather than strictly computer science. I am applying to computer science graduate programs, and I belive that distinction is more important
I do like kaiser's suggestion to drop 221 since it is introductory. 411 will show mastery of 221

purpose
*:retaking a C
433: 627 Theory of Computability prereq
431: career experience
	would prevent me from taking 606 Software Engineering for credit
	wouldn't be a useful credit in grad ai degree
	(I would prefer to take 604 Programing Languages instead)
421: general interest
	(I would prefer taking 633 Machine Learning, and 421 prevents me)

plans (in preferred order)
h  plan class						purpose ↵*problems
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9  433	Formal Languages and Automata			retake upper-level CS C's on transcript
   411	*Design and Analysis of Algorithms		take a new class i'm interested in
   314	*Programming Languages				partial kaiser approval
	415/135 = 3.074		Δ 0.112
	no lab
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9  421	Machine Learning				retake upper-level CS C's on transcript
   411	*Design and Analysis of Algorithms		take a ML showing interest in AI, but prevent myself from taking 600 level
   314	*Programming Languages				partial kaiser approval
	415/135 = 3.074		Δ 0.112
	no lab
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10 431	Software Engineering				retake upper-level CS C's on transcript
   411	*Design and Analysis of Algorithms		take a class that will help me even if grad school doesn't work
   314	*Programming Languages				*feels like a cop-out right now. I am confident, and it is still available during grad school
	419/136 = 3.081		Δ 0.119
	2h lab
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11 411	*Design and Analysis of Algorithms		retake all major CS C's on transcript
   314	*Programming Languages				*ignoring kaiser's suggestion in order to focus on CS classes rather than CE (CS masters)
   221	*Data Structures and Algorithms			*ignoring kaiser's suggestion against 221
	411/132 = 3.114		Δ 0.152
	3h lab

deadline (summer): mar-1
full-time(summer): 8h
	3 classes or 5h+3h
goal: all A's

decision
I like the 9-hour plans the most, although it gives the lowest GPA bump I believe that they show the most improvement/interest in CS. 411 should do a good job at covering for 221 (but perhaps should be mentioned on apps)
433 seems like a fun theory class and it will allow me to take another fun theory class at graduate level (627)
I would only consider taking 421 if I could take it with Dr. Ioger. I would prefer to take it at graduate level rather than post-bacc/undergrad, especially since I would gain more from a full semester
431 would be my choice in the situation where 433/421 isn't offered during the summer
221 if I cannot fill a third class with anything above/interesting over the summer

I can also take both summer semesters, and take more classes for a better GPA jump
