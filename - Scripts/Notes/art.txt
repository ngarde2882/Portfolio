start thinking about art projects:

prime numbers plotted polar
	increase/decrease zoom
		depicts swirl then 'hyperspace' lines
		speeds will have to differ between states
	zoomed in
		0  swirl
		1  mw
		2 lines
	zoomed out
	
	set on timer with clock
		[0,0],[12,1],[24,2] nothing at 0, infinity at 24
		[0,0],[6,1],[12,2],[18,1],[24,0] pulse

lissajous curves
	photo
	plotting a line that decays with time

z(θ)=e^(θi)+e^(piθi)

dance of earth and venus
	line between centers
	really just a comparison of speed and radii from sun
	greek name about gods

servo motor panels
	zachary aie project
	tile sound important

1 build an engine to display a graph on a set background (blank) and display points (dots)
2 polar graph
3 zoom
	3a plot additional
	3b delete memory under radius
		3bi if n points under radius, replace with radius circle
		3bii n increments as r gets larger
4 leave a line behind from a point
5 decaying line
