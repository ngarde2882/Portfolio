recipe book + search published recipes / meal planner / kitchen inventory / grocery list
-> user can stock the recipe book with many of their recipies, perhaps even images or default images so lighting etc is better
Recipe Book
-> allow for sharing recipe book filetype for social aspect but not in your face
-> converter for copy/paste to directly convert recipies from websites into it
-> recipe filetype would hold ingredient amounts as well as directions to complete the dish, maybe also mealtype, breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack/sides/drink
Meal Planner
-> meal planner is a 7-day look ahead (drag for more) where you can pin meals that you want to plan to cook as well as mark grocery store trips
-> tap a day to add a meal/snack to it
--> prioritize snacks chosen multiple times a week and things in stock but not immediately used
-> allow the OPTION for calorie counting
--> see if you can calculate calories purely based on ingredients
Kitchen Inventory
-> kitchen inventory should keep track of spices, oils, grains, everything, but only log amounts for perishables like fruits, veggies, and meat
-> this is kinda a name for the personal database for the user, but probably shouldn't be seen by the user
-> maybe shows only perishables to the user
-> empty at first
Grocery List
-> the user's interface with the kitchen inventory
-> adding a recipe to the meal planner will add all of its ingredients to the grocery list
-> at first spices and oils will be added, but once a non-perishable is 'checked' off its boolean will flip until a user adds it back to the list manually

-> build a little kindle tablet sorta thing like electronic paper
--> give it a little swivel dock that stays on a countertop
--> design UI
--> make an app&webapp for phone and computer integration and design a way for users to be texted their list and maybe also a scheduled send
--> maybe do an 'ok google' sorta voice control for saying im out of x
--> this can be implemented in houses through the ebook, phones, computers, and smart devices
--> this can be implemented in restaurants by increasing scale of dishes made and logging all ingredients to make managing easier
--> white/dark greay background choices, pastel orange blue green pink.. trim
